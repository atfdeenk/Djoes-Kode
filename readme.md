# Djoes Kode

Im building a responsive website inspired by a juice cafe.
The website has Dark Mode toggle, a sticky top navigation bar, a functional hamburger menu that only shows up in smaller device, asymmetrical grid, responsive background image, and responsive image with **picture + source + srcset method**, has a grid layout displaying several image. The website also has a grid layout displaying several image and a **_Contact Us_** form to send a message by filling out their **name, email, choosing a country where they came from and writing a message they want to deliver**. Then click the button for sending their message. I style the text in the website using an embedded from google font named **_Sour Gummy_** and applying text shadow on every text. Also, styling the list using **_katakana-iroha_**. I also added some animation on various part to sweeten things up.ðŸ˜Š
